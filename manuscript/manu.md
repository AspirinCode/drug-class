# Title: Deep Learning-Based Functional Classification of Drug Molecules Using Image Representations

### Introduction 
Accurate prediction of a small molecule's functional effect in an organism would drastically reduce the cost of drug development and toxicity testing, which are both multi-billion dollar industries. Classification using 



### Results

1. graphical workflow and neural network architecture
2. classification performance similar to fig. 2 of Aliper A., et al., Mol. Pharm. (2016)
i. classification of using pictures
ii. classification using overfitting with resnet out the box
iii. classification using X?
3. Confusion matrix


##### *ideas* 


compare results with fewer examples of abundance classes - 'balancing'
