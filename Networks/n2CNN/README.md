# CNN plan

1. get SMILES
2. Assign some functional class (not sure how to do this or where to get the classes yet)
3. draw pictures from SMILES using RDKIT
4. Train CNN to distinguish classes
5. also try retraining only later layers of model trained on Imagenet as in fastai example
6. plot metrics etc

### TODO:
a. figure out functional categories or drug classes
b. take smiles from the LINCS pert_info.txt file instead
c. implement CNN including training loop
d. take resnet model from fastai lesson1.ipynb
